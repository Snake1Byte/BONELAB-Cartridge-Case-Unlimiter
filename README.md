A mod that disables the automatic despawning of cartridge casings that fly out of weapons.

## Features

- Unlimited cartridges for cinematic effect (or for whatever reason this might be desirable)
- Can be disabled and enabled inside of the BoneMenu
- All cartridges in the scene can be despawned with one button press
- Cartridge limit can be increased and decreased easily inside of the BoneMenu
- Additionally, there is a despawn timer in BONELAB that despawns cartridge casings after 30 seconds. This is being handled by this mod as well. This mod can change the despawn timer's limit.
- Easy to use buttons in the BoneMenu for adding and removing 10, 100 or 1000 cartridges from the game's maximum cartridge limit
- Analogous for the despawn timer: easy to use buttons for increasing or decreasing the despawn timer by 1, 10 or 60 minutes

## Limitations 

- If the despawn timer or cartridge limit is *decreased*, the effect will only be visible with cartridges that have been spawned AFTER the decreasing of the despawn timer / cartridge limiter. The amount of cartridges in the scene will not sink in parallel to your maximum cartridge setting in the BoneMenu
- Your settings will not be saved and will be discarded upon each game restart (for now). Default settings are: 1000 maximum cartridges, 5 minutes despawn timer
